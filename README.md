# Random Words App
## Scraping Words and Definitions

Using Jsoup in an Android app in order to scrape a "Word of the Day" and, subsequently, a random word after that.

After WoTT or Random Words have been fetched, the program will also scrape the web for the word's definition.

The app uses kotlin coroutines, such as suspend functions, withContext and runBlocking, in order for jsoup to work.

Everything was created using IntelliJ Idea.
